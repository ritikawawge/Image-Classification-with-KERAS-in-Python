Image-Classification-with-KERAS-in-Python
Develop an image classification system using the Keras framework in Python to accurately categorize images into predefined classes, showcasing the power of deep learning in computer vision tasks.
Collect and preprocess a diverse dataset of images relevant to the chosen classification task. Apply data augmentation techniques to enhance model generalization by introducing variations such as rotations, flips, and brightness adjustments.
Design a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture using Keras, comprising multiple layers of convolution, pooling, and dense units. Train the model on the preprocessed dataset, utilizing techniques like transfer learning if appropriate, and fine-tune hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance.
