The project aimed to realize image classification using the Keras framework in Python, focusing on harnessing the capabilities of deep learning and neural networks. The goal was to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that could accurately categorize images. The project began with meticulous data collection, preprocessing, and augmentation to create a robust dataset. Leveraging Keras, a CNN architecture was designed and fine-tuned, exploiting the power of deep learning. Model training involved optimizing hyperparameters and potentially incorporating transfer learning. Post-training, the model's performance was rigorously evaluated through various metrics, including visualization of results like training/validation curves and confusion matrices. Ultimately, the trained model was successfully deployed, demonstrating its proficiency in real-world image classification scenarios.
